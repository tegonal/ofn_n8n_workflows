# n8n Workflows for Open Food Network  

This repository contains a collection of workflows developed in [n8n](https://n8n.io/) to extend the functionality of the [Open Food Network (OFN)](https://openfoodnetwork.org/). These workflows automate common processes, integrate external services, and optimize tasks to enhance the management of platforms built on OFN.

## Introduction  

The Open Food Network is an open-source platform that enables local food networks to thrive by connecting producers, distributors, and consumers. These n8n workflows are designed to help platform administrators automate repetitive tasks, streamline operations, and integrate with third-party tools like email services, CRMs, or analytics platforms.  

## Requirements  

To use these workflows, you'll need:  

1. An [n8n](https://n8n.io/) instance (self-hosted or cloud).  
2. Access to your Open Food Network platform.  
3. API credentials for any third-party services you plan to integrate (e.g., Mailchimp, Google Sheets).  

## Installation  

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n8n-ofn-workflows.git  
   cd n8n-ofn-workflows  
    Import the workflows into your n8n instance:
        Open your n8n dashboard.
        Go to the Workflows section.
        Click on Import and upload the .json files from this repository.

    Configure the workflows to match your OFN setup:
        Update API endpoints and credentials in the workflows as needed.
        Adjust any specific parameters to fit your requirements.
